# 🚀 Scalable System Design & Implementation

**Project Level**: Intermediate

**Focus**: Infrastructure, Load Balancing, and Database Scaling (Read/Write Splitting)

## 📝 1. Project Overview

The objective of this project is to build a functional, **scalable backend infrastructure** from scratch. You will move beyond simple application development to focus on how **traffic is distributed** and how **data remains consistent** across multiple nodes. You are required to set up a **load-balanced environment** with a **replicated database architecture**.

---

## 🏗️ 2. System Architecture Requirements

Your implementation must consist of the following main components:

- **⚖️ Load Balancer (Nginx or HAProxy):** Acts as the **single entry point**. It must distribute incoming traffic to the backend nodes using a **Round Robin** or **Least Connections** algorithm.
- **💻 Application Layer (2x API Nodes):** Two identical instances of a **REST API** (Node.js, Python, Go, etc.) running on separate ports or containers.
- **🗄️ Database Layer (Master-Slave Replication):**
  - **Master Node:** Handles all **Write / Read** operations (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, GET).
  - **Slave Node (Read Replica):** Synchronizes data from the Master and handles **Read** operations (GET).

## 🛠️ 3. Functional Requirements (The API)

The API logic is intentionally kept simple to focus on the infrastructure setup. It must include:

- **📥 POST /products:**
  - **Action:** Validates and saves product data (Name, Price) into the **Master Database**.
  - **Response:** Success message and the data created.
- **📤 GET /products:**
  - **Action:** Fetches the list of products from the **Slave Database**.
  - **Response:** List of products + **Server Metadata** (e.g., `"processed_by": "Node_A"`). This is crucial to prove the **Load Balancer** is working.

---

## ⚙️ 4. Technical Implementation Steps

You must document and record each of the following phases:

### 🔹 Phase 1: Database Replication Setup

- Configure the **Master** node.
- Configure the **Slave** node.
- **Verify synchronization** by inserting data into Master and checking the Slave.

### 🔹 Phase 2: API Development & Read/Write Splitting

- Implement the API logic.
- **Critical:** Configure the app to use **two different connection strings**: one for Writes (**Master IP**) and one for Reads (**Slave IP**).

### 🔹 Phase 3: Infrastructure & Load Balancing

- Deploy **two instances** of the API.
- Configure the **Load Balancer** to proxy requests to both API nodes.
- Ensure the Load Balancer performs **health checks**.

### 🔹 Phase 4: Verification & Stress Test

- Use **curl** or Postman to send multiple requests.
- Verify that the **Server ID** toggles between Node 1 and Node 2.
- Verify that data written to the Master is visible when querying the Slave.

## 📦 5. Deliverables

### A. Technical Documentation (PDF or Markdown)

- **System Architecture Diagram:** A visual representation of your setup.
- **Configuration Snippets:** Key settings for Nginx, Database, and your API’s database connection logic.
- **Setup Guide:** A clear, step-by-step manual that a peer could follow to reproduce your environment.

### B. Video Demonstration

- **Duration:** 5 - 10 minutes.
- **Walkthrough**: Briefly show the code and configuration files.
- **Live Demo:**
  - 1. Show **POST** requests saving to the Master
  - 2. Show **GET** requests being balanced between two nodes.
  - 3. The **"Chaos" Test**: Manually shut down one API node and show that the system remains operational via the second node.
